This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) v12 project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) and set up to be instantly deployed to [Netlify](https://url.netlify.com/SyTBPVamO)!

[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/netlify-templates/next-netlify-starter&utm_source=github&utm_medium=nextstarter-cs&utm_campaign=devex-cs)

(If you click this button, it will create a new repo for you that looks exactly like this one, and sets that repo up immediately for deployment on Netlify)

### Running the PRLX Dashboard

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

#### Installation Options

**Option one:** One-click deploy

[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/netlify-templates/next-netlify-starter&utm_source=github&utm_medium=nextstarter-cs&utm_campaign=devex-cs)

**Option two:** Manual clone

1. Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/netlify-templates/next-netlify-starter.git`
2. Navigate to the directory and run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run dev`
4. Make your changes
5. Connect to [Netlify](https://url.netlify.com/Bk4UicocL) manually (the `netlify.toml` file is the one you'll need to make sure stays intact to make sure the export is done and pointed to the right stuff)
